# Spring Boot REST API with PostgreSQL
#### This project is a Spring Boot-based RESTful API implementation that integrates with a PostgreSQL database. It follows a layered architecture consisting of API layer, Business Logic layer, and Data Layer.

## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot: Framework for creating standalone, production-grade Spring-based applications.
- Spring Data JPA: Simplifies the implementation of data access layers using JPA and Hibernate.
- PostgreSQL: Object-relational database system known for reliability and robustness.
- Maven: Dependency management and build automation tool.
  
## Project Structure
The project is structured into the following layers:

- API Layer: Exposes RESTful endpoints to interact with the application.
- Business Logic Layer: Contains business logic and validation rules.
- Data Layer: Handles data access and persistence to the PostgreSQL database.
